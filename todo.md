Add description:
The goal of this package is to make a workflow that is as easy to understand as possible for new users, while not sacrificing any convenience for accustomed users.

Overengineering of solutions can often lead to individuals not understanding the
workflow which can lead to frustration. Especially for new people to the project.
This package is designed to welcoming for newcomers, while prioritizing the
convenience of the experienced user. It thus strikes a hard balance between
simplicity, convenience and power. Thus if you feel experienced with python packages
and feel that this package is too simple, you are probably right and you might want
to look at the hypermodern python cookiecutter template instead. Potentially you
will end up creating a new template that is more suited to your needs. borrowing the 
best ideas from this template and the hypermodern python template.
