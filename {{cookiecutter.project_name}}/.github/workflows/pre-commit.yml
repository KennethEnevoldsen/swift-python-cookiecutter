            ‚ú® Looks like some pre-commit hooks failed. Those that could be fixed automatically have been comitted to the branch. ‚ú®
            
            We suggest using `git pull --rebase` to apply them locally. If some hooks failed for other reasons, you can:
            
            üïµÔ∏è Examine them in the `Run pre-commit` section of the `pre-commit` worklow, or 
            üèéÔ∏è Run them locally by running `pre-commit run --hook-stage push --all-files`
